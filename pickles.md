## Fermented Pickles

### The key

A couple tricks:

1. To ensure the brine stays clear, use salt without iodine.
2. To make sure the pickles stay crisp, cut off the tip of the *blossom* end, which contain enzymes that make the pickle salty. If your pickles don't have stem, the blossom end is not the indented end

### Make brine

We are aiming for a 3.5-5% brine, which means that by weight, salt should compose 3.5-5% of the solution.

If you want to aim for half-sour pickles, go for 3.5%. Cornichons use a 5.0%

Tip: Use a kitchen scale to weigh the salt, overly salty pickles are a sad thing to confront after days of fermentation.
