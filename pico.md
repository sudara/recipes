## Pico De Gallo (Salsa Fresca)


### The key

In my opinion, the key to good pico is not the ripeness of the tomatoes. It's the ratio of acid (lime), salt and a freshness from onion and cilantro (substitute parsley if you have soap-heads coming over to dinner)


### Ingredients

* 4-5 large tomatoes
* A small handful of fresh cilantro (substitute 2 tablespoons frozen or leave out if you don't have)
* 1/2 a red onion, finely diced. Substitute white onion or green onions on your whim.
* Juice of 1 lime
* 1 Jalapeño. Substitute anything you can here, including other fresh peppers, frozen diced Jalapeño, Habanero seeds, even Chipotle powder in a pinch.
* Salt

### Prep

1. Dice the tomatoes and drain them. I usually just take handfuls of the diced tomato and hand-squeeze the juice out of them over the cutting board before placing in a large bowl.
