## Mousse Au Chocolat

### The Key

Goal with the chocolate mixture is to create a balanced but strong choc mixture which will later be "diluted" by the egg whites.

### Ingredients

4 Servings

* 4 eggs
* 100g bar of dark choc 70-99%
* 2-4 tablespoons sugar, depending on choc %
* Dab of butter (optional)
* 1/4-1/2 cup milk

### Prep

Whip egg whites in a medium bowl until they form stiff peaks.

### Cook

Melt choc over double boiler. Stir in butter, 2 of the egg yolks and milk while it's melting. You'll have 2 egg yolks leftover to save for another day.

Once it's melted, sure it's sweet enough by adding sugar to taste.

Make sure it's smooth enough by adding milk. It should be pourable and glossy, not lumpy and thick.

It doesn't need to stay on the heat longer than it takes to melt and mix the ingredients.

Take it off the heat and let it cool for a couple minutes, stirring to keep it glossy.

Fold in the warm choc mixture to the egg whites with a large spoon or silicon spatula until there are no large clumps of visible egg white. Don't over-fold, you want things to stay fluffy. The worst that can happen by underfolding is you might get some solid chocolate chunks.

Refrigerate overnight to set, or at least a couple hours (it'll still be glossy and soft)
