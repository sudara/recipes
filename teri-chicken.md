## Teri Chicken

### Key To Good Teri Chicken

* Too much undiluted soy sauce + hours of marinating will make the chicken too salty. If you will marinate overnight, a 1:1 soy to water ratio is probably best. Otherwise you can use less water.
* You don't *have* to marinate â€” in that case I would cook longer at a lower temp so the meat has more contact time with the marinade.

### Ingredients

* 4-8 chicken thighs. Don't use breast meat. Can be bone in or bone out. Ideally skin on. I like bone in, cooked for a long time, so it's falling off the bone.
* 1 onion, cut in half, then sliced into thin slices

Marinade:

* Peel and slice an inch of ginger into rough slices (optional)
* 3/4 cup soy sauce (or Tamari, which is less salty)
* 1/2 cup water (needed to water down if you don't use Tamari)
* 1/2 to 3/4 cup brown sugar
* Tablespoon of sesame oil
* Couple smashed cloves of peeled garlic
* 2 tablespoons of Mirin or rice vinegar


### Prep

1. Make marinade in a Tupperware / bowl. Add chicken. Ideally all chicken is tightly packed and submerged in the container.
2. Marinate 1 hr to overnight

### Cook

Best is on the BBQ!

Frying pan: 

* Pull the chicken out of the marinade and onto a plate
* Keep the marinade, you'll make a pan sauce with it. 
* You can pat the chicken dry a bit, it'll help browning.
* Put in a couple tablespoons of oil of your choice into the frying pan. Olive oil or veggie oil are both fine.
* Sear for a couple minutes on each side on high heat. The goal should be to get some browning. A bit of black is ok too. It doesn't need to be cooked through, as it'll cook more in the next step.
* Add the marinade back to the pan

If you want a nice thick glaze sauce (also good for BBQ glaze), bring the marinade to boil for 2 min with:

* A tablespoon of cornstarch first mixed in a 1/3 cup of cold water until no lumps remain

Taste and adjust the sweet / sour / salty.

You could also do the oven instead of the frying pan:

1. Preheat oven at 350 degrees 
2. Put onions and marinade in dish
3. Put an extra 1/2 cup water in dish
4. Arrange pieces skin side up 

### Serve

* With sticky rice
* With steamed cabbage
