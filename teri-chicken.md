## Teri Chicken

### Key To Good Teri Chicken


* Too much undiluted soy sauce + hours of marinating will make the chicken quite salty.
* You don't have to marinate, in that case I would cook longer at a lower temp so the meat has more contact time with the marinade.

### Ingredients

* 4-8 chicken thighs. Don't use breast meat. Can be bone in or bone out. But should be skin on. I like bone in, cooked for a long time, so it's falling off the bone.
* 1 onion, cut in half, then sliced into thin slices

Marinade:

* Peel and slice an inch of ginger into rough slices
* 3/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* tablespoon or two of sesame oil
* Couple cloves of peeled garlic
* 2 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar (or mirin)

### Prep

1. Make marinade in a tupperware / bowl and add chicken. Ideally all chicken is tightly packed and submerged in the container.
2. Marinate 1 hr

### Cook

1. Preheat oven at 350 degrees 
2. Put onions and marinade in dish
3. Put 3/4 cup water in dish
3. Arrange pieces skin side up

### Serve

* With sticky rice
* With steamed cabbage
