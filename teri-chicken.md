## Teri Chicken

### Key To Good Teri Chicken

* Too much undiluted soy sauce + hours of marinating will make the chicken quite salty.
* You don't have to marinate, in that case I would cook longer at a lower temp so the meat has more contact time with the marinade.

### Ingredients

* 4-8 chicken thighs. Don't use breast meat. Can be bone in or bone out. But should be skin on. I like bone in, cooked for a long time, so it's falling off the bone.
* 1 onion, cut in half, then sliced into thin slices

Marinade:

* Peel and slice an inch of ginger into rough slices
* 3/4 cup soy sauce (or Tamari, which is less salty)
* 1/3 cup water (needed to water down if you don't use Tamari)
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* Tablespoon of sesame oil
* Couple smashed cloves of peeled garlic
* 2 tablespoons of Mirin

If you want a thicker glaze sauce (best for BBQ), bring the above to a boil for 2 min with:

* A tablespoon of cornstarch first mixed in a 1/3 cup of water until no lumps remain

### Prep

1. Make marinade in a Tupperware / bowl and add chicken. Ideally all chicken is tightly packed and submerged in the container.
2. Marinate 1 hr to overnight

### Cook

Best is on the BBQ!

Otherwise the oven is great:

1. Preheat oven at 350 degrees 
2. Put onions and marinade in dish
3. Put an extra 1/2 cup water in dish
3. Arrange pieces skin side up

And in a covered frying pan works great too.

### Serve

* With sticky rice
* With steamed cabbage
