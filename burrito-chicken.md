## Chipotle Chicken

### The Key

The key to good chicken breast is

1. Avoiding initially overcooking at all costs. You can literally undercook this in the first part of the recipe and then put back on the heat before eating.
2. Letting it sit for a while after cooking, preferably in a flavorful sauce  (hence the butter/lime/spices)

## Ingredients

* 4 Chicken breasts
* Juice from 1 lime
* 2 tablespoons butter or veggie oil

## Chicken "rub"

* Salt
* Onion powder
* Pepper
* Oregano
* Cumin
* Paprika Powder
* Chipotle powder

## Prep

Think of this as a 2 part process:

Part I, we rub and then sear the chicken in butter.

Part II, we dice and put back into the pan with sauces.

1. Get a decent sized frying pan hot hot. You'll want each piece of chicken to have it's own space on the pan, full contact. Open windows if you don't have great ventilation.
2. Take out the chicken breasts. Optional: If they are very plump, you can horizontally flay them so they are thinner and more even thickness.
3. Go to town with salt and the spices from the rub on both sides.
4. Put butter in pan
5. Sear on both sides for a couple minutes, then cover and turn the heat off and let the residual heat cook them.
6. After 15 minutes of resting, take the breasts out of the juice and dice them into chunky burrito-friendly cubes.
7. Don't worry if the chicken is underdone. Put the cubes back in the pan with the sauce, and coat the chicken with the pan sauce. Add juice from 1 lime, and more chipotle/chili powder.
8. Cover again, and warm back up when you are ready to serve.
