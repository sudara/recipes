## Granola

Very quick to make, very easy to improvise with. Dump things in a big mixing bowl and bake for 20 min.

I recommend doing a double batch, but you'll have to bake them on 2 sheets or in 2 batches for them to cook evenly.

### Ingredients

* 4 cups any kind of oats. Big thick rolled oats will be more flakey
* 1 cup (optional) of any nut. It's better texturally if you chop up or food process them.
* 1/2 cup of any sweetener. Honey is a classic. Maple syrup is strong and nice. Brown suger gives a looser texture
* 1/2 cup of a neutral tasting oil, like veggie oil
* Pinch of salt
* (optional) Splash of vanilla extract or pinch of vanilla bean or cinnamon.
* (optional, cheating) Use pecans as the nut, half a cup of chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of cocoa for a dessert breakfast.

### Prep

Dump everything in a big mixing bowl and make sure everything is evenly coated.

### Cook

* Bake on 150C / 300F for about 25 min or until the edges are brown. 
* Stir halfway through the cook time. 
* Press down after stirring if you like big crunchy chunks. 

It will take 2-3 hours of cooling to get crisp. Wait until then to package in an airtight glass or plastic container.
