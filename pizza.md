## Pizza Dough

### Tips

Good pizza dough should use Type 00 flour for the right chew / char.

If you want the pizza crust to get any amount of char and crisp:

1) It needs to be cooked in an oven that gets up to 250C/480F.
2) It needs to be placed directly on a hot surface in that oven. This can be a heavy duty baking rack / steel / brick.

The longer you let the dough hang out, the more flavor will develop. Ideally 1/2 of the yeast here is replaced by sourdough yeast.

### Dough Ingredients

For 3-4 italian / personal sized pizzas

* 500g type 00 flour
* 7g active dry yeast (1 packet)
* 300 ml water
* 1.5 teaspoons salt

### Dough Prep

Grab a big bowl. Put flour and salt in bowl, make a little hole in the middle, pour the water and the yeast there.

Let sit for a couple min.

Stir and mix for 3 min. Let sit for 15 min.

Knead dough for 15 min and then split into 3-4 pieces (500g) or 6-8 pieces (1kg).

Leave covered on a heavily floured surface to rise for up to 2 hours OR refrigerate for 8-24 hours and remove 30  min before pizza shaping time.

### Sauce

The best pizza sauce is uncookeded. It uses canned tomatoes under the assumption that they are going to be more flavorful than anything you can get fresh.

Puree in food processor / blender:

* 1 can whole italian tomato
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2+ garlic cloves
* salt to taste
