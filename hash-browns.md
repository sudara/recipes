## Hash Browns

The key to good hash browns: 

1. DRY potato shreds. If the potato is too wet, they'll be gummy and mushy and the outside won't get crisp.

2. Enough oil. A good amount of oil is the difference between well cooked hashbrowns and hashbrowns that are both burnt AND undercooked. When it doubt, put in more. 

3. The right amount of heat. Too low will result in mashed-potato-y interior. Too high and the insides won't be fully cooked.

### Ingredients

* 2 large Russet Potatos (baked potato sized) or 3-5 smaller potatos. 
* 3 tablespoons oil with high smoke point. This means canola, rapeseed, veggie oil. NOT olive oil.
* (Optional) 1/2 diced onion

### Prep

1. Peel potatos for the authentic route. You can opt to leave the skins on. Benefit: Less work AND more healthy. 
2. Grate potatoes. You can use a food processor for this. 
3. Put grated potatos in a larger bowl and put LOTS of cold water in it. Stir around. 
4. Strain potatos 
5. REPEAT steps 3/4 until water runs clear. Usually takes 3 strains. You can use my trick, which is to have a strainer that fits inside a bowl, fill the hybrid bowl-strainer with water, then remove the bowl.
6. THIS IS THE VERY IMPORTANT STEP of drying the potatos. Do this by first squeezing the water out of the potatos with one hand as much as possible. Then use a clean dish towel or a paper towl and push the potatos against the strainer walls. 
7. Season the potatos with generous amount of salt and pepper

### Cook

1. Heat oil in pan over medium heat. 
2. Put all DRY potatos in pan in one go. Don't turn them around. You just want to build a pancake quickly. It can stay fluffy, no need to pack things down or worry about it being consistent. 
3. Cook for 5-8 minutes, or until the very edges look brown. You can peek with a spatula under an edge and check out the under side. When looks brown like at the restaurant, flip the entire pancake, or divide into 4 pieces and flip individually. If it's a bit burnt, turn it down a bit and make a mental note for next time. If it's not fully brown on the bottom, turn it up a bit.
4. Cook for another 2-3 min.
