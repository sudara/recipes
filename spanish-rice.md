## Spanish Rice

### The key

Some people like their spanish rice pretty bland, with just some tumeric and paprika. For a good flavor, you need to use a nice chicken stock.

### Ingredients

1. Olive Oil
2. 2 Cups of Rice
3. 2 2/3 Cups of Stock (or same amount of water + a boullion cube)
4. 1 tomato, 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes, or 1-2 tablespoons of tomato paste
5. 1/2 a big onion or 1 small onion
6. Paprika
7. Tumeric

### Cook

1. Heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil on medium heat in a smaller pot.
2. Put the onions in and stir occasionally for a few min until they go translucent. 
3. Put the rice in and stir for a minute or two.
4. Put the spices and tomato in
5. Put the stock in
6. Turn up the heat and bring to a simmer, should take just a couple min considering the rice is already hot.
7. Turn the head down to the lowest setting and cover
8. Remove from heat after 15-20 min and fluff.
